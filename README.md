# varroa-virus-knockdown
## Nurit Eliash, Miyuki Suenaga and Alexander Mikheyev

This project aims to understand how vector gene expression interacts with its viral load.
We experinemtally validated the hub-genes in the networks, based on gene network analysis [here](https://nurit-eliash.github.io/varroa-virus-networks/).
by knocking down (unsing RNAi-silencing), then measuring the viral load. 
Experimental procedures and supplementary material can be found in [the manuscript](___)

### Code and original figures can be found [here](https://nurit-eliash.github.io/varroa-virus-knockdown/).
